We support uploading of ebooks that are in PDF format. Our pricing is based primarily on the monthly volume of uploaded documents. If you have a ballpark estimate of this number, I can send you a quote. The downloading feature can be enabled or disabled at anytime.

Here is one approach you may want to consider for watermarking a document:
- Upload a document to Crocodoc's API to convert it to HTML.
- Download the PDF version of the file that we generate as part of our conversion process.
- Watermark the PDF using any number of open-source PDF manipulation libraries (e.g. iText).
- Re-upload the watermarked PDF to Crocodoc.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

If you've set up an evaluation account, we can link it to your S3 bucket. Please follow the instructions below to set up your S3 bucket and then send us your S3 bucket name as well as your Crocodoc user name.

S3 instructions:

To set up S3, you'll need to create a bucket that will house all the assets Crocodoc creates. Ideally, this bucket should start out empty and not be used for anything besides Crocodoc. IMPORTANT: When creating the bucket, make sure it's name contains nothing but lower-case letters, numbers, and hyphens.

Once this bucket is created, you'll need to grant our AWS account full permissions (List, Upload/Delete, View Permissions, Edit Permissions) on the bucket. Our AWS account is identified by my admin@crocodoc.com; so that's what should go in the ""Grantee"" field if you're using the AWS web console to set this up.

We do not support JSONP as it would require that you expose your API token in the enduser's browser.

We recommend you keep your API token strictly confidential and do not try to use our API via javascript in a browser.

For a customizations like these that requires direct access to the document's DOM, you can use our docviewer.js integration that is described at https://crocodoc.com/docs/js-intro/ which allows you to embed documents without the use of an iframe. It does not yet have built-in support for exposing annotation-related events (such as clicks), but it should be possible to do so with a bit of creativity :-) We do not offer the ability to store arbitrary metadata for a given annotation; that would have to be something you track on your own servers. Our Webhooks API (https://crocodoc.com/docs/webhooks/) should be useful for obtaining annotation timestamps.

If you do decide to try using docviewer.js, please let us know how your experience with it goes or if you have any questions or feedback about it.

265,"E78903010","Hi Brian,

The viewable property being true implies at least the first page of the document is ready for viewing. The viewable property of the document status method will be False until the first page of the document has been successfully converted. Once the first page is converted, it'll change to True and remain True unless there's an error later on in the conversion process (in which case it'll change back to False and the ""status"" property of the document status function will be ERROR). As such, the viewable property is unaware of any viewing sessions you create for the document.

Please let us know if that didn't answer your question!

Thanks,
Matt","2012-06-16 01:05:31","matt@crocodoc.com","y"
265,"E79561318","There isn't currently a way to check if a given session has expired. The general workflow we see being used is to generate a new session each time an enduser will be viewing a page with an embedded document on it.

I do sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. This decision was not made lightly. We feel it will be in the best interest of our users going forward as the newer version of the API have significantly improved over the older ones.

It is not necessary for your website to be running on https (although we do recommend it) since all Crocodoc API requests should be coming directly from your server which should be able to make outgoing https requests to our servers. As long as you make the document viewing URLs in the HTML you're serving to your endusers uses the https protocol instead of http, the process should theoretically work.

Your current rate limit allows you 2 simultaneous conversions, so as long as you stay within that limit (i.e. you wait for existing conversions to finish before uploading more than 2) you should be able to convert 7K documents fairly quickly (I'd estimate about 24 hours or so, depending on the average size of each file).

394,"E88672400","Rajesh,

After some investigation on our end (greatly aided by the request/response info you provided), we discovered that the root issue is that the user IDs you are supplying fall outside our support range. As mentioned on our API Reference (https://crocodoc.com/docs/api/#session-create), user IDs should must be signed 32-bit integers. As such, the largest valid user ID is 2147483647. For reference, the user ID in the request you've pasted above is  223878386387255300.

There is a bug in our session validation that permitted invalid values to be accepted. Normally, a session generation request with an invalid user ID would be rejected from the onset.

We will be deploying a fix to our session validation shortly and will update the wording of our documentation to be more explicit.

I realize this means you'll need to make changes on your end to the user IDs you are sending to Crocodoc and I apologize very much for that! If you would like to correct the IDs of users already in the Crocodoc system, please provide a list of new IDs and I'll be happy to make those changes for you.

Again, we're very sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

1. With the new API, documents are only viewable via sessions. That way, you can finely control who has access to your documents. For now, sessions expire after 60 minutes. We might eventually enable enhanced control over when a session expires.

2. when creating a session that enables annotations, you must provide us with a user id so we know who is annotating the document. A unique session must be generated per user.

3. Unfortunately, images uploads are no longer supported.","2012-07-25 22:50:03","peter@crocodoc.com","y"

You can use Crocodoc to convert Microsoft Office and PDF documents to HTML5 so your users can view them on your web site. We support individual file sizes up to 100 MB . 

Our pricing is based on number of documents converted to HTML5 (once a document has been uploaded it can be viewed and annotated an unlimited number of times). 

We offer a number of pricing plans starting at $250/month for up to 2,500 document uploads/month with additional uploads pro-rated at $0.25 each. If you are considering higher monthly document volumes, we can customize a discounted plan for you.

We don't have any examples of text searching.  If you use the API to download the extracted text for a document, you should be able to implement any sort of text searching functionality you wish.   When the viewer itself is visible, the browser's built-in search functions should work as well.

Crocodoc does not provide any sort of text protection for documents.  Even if we were to try to add something like that, if the text itself is visible in the browser then there will always be a way for a user to copy that text however they wish.  What is the end goal you are trying to accomplish?  Perhaps there is another approach that we do support.

490,"E92710157","Hi Jesse,

Crocodoc does not currently have the capability to translate annotations from other platforms into our own format.  I believe that some Word comments and tracked changes may propagate to the converted HTML document, but beyond that I do not believe any pre-existing annotations will be displayed.  If a document with annotations is uploaded to Crocodoc and then the original is downloaded, the pre-existing annotations should still be there.  However if the marked-up version is downloaded, I do not think they will be.

We would like to add complete interoperability with other document markup systems, but do not have any ETA on when this might be available.  I'm sorry if this is causing hardship for your users - let us know if it looks like this may soon become a serious issue for you, and we can reevaluate the complexity of adding this feature.

Bennett","2012-08-01 22:24:30","bennett@crocodoc.com","y"
490,"E93181806","Jesse,

If a document is annotated in Crocodoc, then when downloading that document there are 2 options: download the original, or download the marked up PDF.  If the original document is downloaded, then it comes down in its original format - .doc, .ppt, or whatever.  It also retains all of its original properties (Office annotations, tracked changes, etc.).  If the marked up PDF is downloaded, then the user will always get a PDF document.  That document will contain all annotations made inside Crocodoc (they won't look exactly the same, due to the way the PDF filetype handles annotations, but they will all be there).  Since the user is getting a PDF, then some of the properties of the original document might be lost.  It's the same as if a document is printed to PDF from within Word or Powerpoint - tracked changes and Office-specific features might be lost.

Crocodoc currently does not have a notion of annotations that exist in the document before it is uploaded.  If you upload a Word document with highlights, for example, then those are not translated into Crocodoc highlights.  So while the highlight may appear in the Crocodoc version of the document, you will just be making another highlight over it if you then use the Crocodoc highlighter.  It's not exactly ""overwriting"", it's just that at the moment Crocodoc ignores pre-existing annotations.

As I mentioned, we would like to enable Crocodoc to understand annotations from all supported filetypes so that we can translate annotations appropriately as files are imported and exported.  Unfortunately that is not currently the case.

Does that answer your questions?

What seems to be happening here is that the profile page is timing out when trying to load and render your 64,000 documents.  One possible fix we could add would be to only pull up a limited number of documents when trying to access that page.  Users who just upload documents via the upload button should never hit this limit, but obviously people who use the API to upload could have a very large number of documents in their account.  If you just want to access the profile page to upload documents manually to your account this fix would help, but obviously it wouldn't be ideal if you're trying to view all 64,000 of your documents for some reason.

An evaluation account should be able to upload the same types of files as a full account.

When uploading from a local file, you must include the file itself as a multipart POST parameter.

512,"E93178570","Hi Tammie,

I'm sorry for the hassles you're experiencing caused by the transition to session-based viewing.  Hopefully I can explain a bit about this new approach.  The typical use case for Crocodoc is to embed documents in other webpages and applications.  When the application or page is viewed, a viewing session (that lasts 1 hour) can easily be generated automatically.  This is the secure approach that you mention.  Generating links for sharing through email etc. is admittedly not optimal under this model. The best option at the moment would be to follow this workflow and have documents embedded in your site, where the viewing sessions can be generated on-demand.  We do hope to add the ability for users to customize the properties of their sessions (e.g. changing the expiration time), but do not have an ETA on that feature at the moment.

Please let us know if there's anything we can do to help your application move towards the session-based viewing model.

Shared links on Personal work as they always have, whereby you can specify the permissions sharing recipients are granted, and links do not expire.

As for your second question, when you use the V2 API to generate an editable viewing session, you specify the usernames and ids of each editor.  But again, if you use Crocodoc Personal, then this is not a concern, since you won't be using the API to generate the sharing session.","2012-08-02 19:02:21","bennett@crocodoc.com","y"

If you are using Amazon S3, we can store the document files in your S3 bucket. Would that work for you? If so, please follow the instructions below and send me your bucket name so we can link it to your Crocodoc account. 

S3 instructions:

To set up S3, you'll need to create a bucket that will house all the assets Crocodoc creates. Ideally, this bucket should start out empty and not be used for anything besides Crocodoc. IMPORTANT: When creating the bucket, make sure it's name contains nothing but lower-case letters, numbers, and hyphens.

Once this bucket is created, you'll need to grant our AWS account full permissions (List, Upload/Delete, View Permissions, Edit Permissions) on the bucket. Our AWS account is identified by my admin@crocodoc.com; so that's what should go in the ""Grantee"" field if you're using the AWS web console to set this up.","2012-08-06 20:29:50","ajoy@crocodoc.com","y"

Thanks so much for reaching out. The inability for bucket owners to access those files is an issue we're aware of, and working to address in the near future. In the meantime, a few things to keep in mind: 

-Rather than opening a crocodoc viewing session with the downloadable value set in order to retrieve the PDF, you can use a get request to download the PDF directly, as described here: https://crocodoc.com/docs/api/#dl-doc
-How we arrange files in S3 could always change, so trying to locate them directly in S3 could lead to problems in the event of a change in the future.

I hope that helps, and thanks again for bringing the issue to our attention. We'll keep you posted as we get the issue resolved. Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any other questions or issues!

Once that is done, let us know the S3 bucket name and the user name of the Crocodoc account that will be used with S3.

S3 instructions:

To set up S3, you'll need to create a bucket that will house all the assets Crocodoc creates. Ideally, this bucket should start out empty and not be used for anything besides Crocodoc. IMPORTANT: When creating the bucket, make sure it's name contains nothing but lower-case letters, numbers, and hyphens.

Once this bucket is created, you'll need to grant our AWS account full permissions (List, Upload/Delete, View Permissions, Edit Permissions) on the bucket. Our AWS account is identified by my admin@crocodoc.com; so that's what should go in the ""Grantee"" field if you're using the AWS web console to set this up.

If you're having trouble using sessions, I'd recommend checking out this part of our API reference: https://crocodoc.com/docs/api/#session-create. There's a lot of really great information in the API reference that should hopefully help address some of your questions.

The UUID would be great! Please send it along. 

One quick clarification: even though during conversion the document is not officially status ""DONE"" for 107.5 seconds, it should be viewable to your users long before that. Perhaps look for viewable = True and see if that time cuts down for you a bit. We're always working to improve our conversion times, though, and you should see those shorten over time!

As for on-premise solutions, we are currently working with a few strategic partners to develop this product, but we can have a discussion to see if that might be a good fit for your project. Ajoy, CC'ed here, can talk to you further about that possibility. Just so you know, it looks like the 100MB limit would still be in place, even for an on-premise solution.

Forgive me, I did manage to get it open (I was apparently having some problems with my version of Excel-- bizarre.) My mistake there, and I'm sorry! 

 I can't be sure what the cause is, but it looks like if you remove the three Criterion tabs, it uploads fine (but if any of them is left in the file, it doesn't.) Unfortunately, I can't be any more specific about why those three tabs are causing problems, but I suspect it may have something to do with the fact that formulas in those tabs reference empty cells.

706,"E102068139","Hi Anil,

Just wanted to give you a quick update. The https issue has been resolved, however, there's still a problem with files from URLs of the type you provided. The issue is that our servers aren't able to determine what type of document (e.g. PDF, Word document, or Powerpoint deck) it supplies. The Content-Type header returned from a URL is the canonical way to indicate what type of file it is. However, it happens somewhat often that servers aren't configured correctly and the content-type header is either missing or incorrect...if we don't positively match a content type header, we fall back to looking for an extension at the end of the URL. (e.g. "".pdf"" in the URL http://web.crocodoc.com/files/test-simple.pdf). This URL doesn't pass either of those tests. As a result, we can't display it. 

Not sure if that information is helpful, but perhaps it will help you going forward. We're working to address this particular issue, but I don't have a timeline on when it will be addressed.

Thanks so much for your patience, and let me know if you run into any other problems,

Unfortunately, simply appending the file type to the end of the url won't work in this case. We're looking into a solution for this issue going forward, but in the meantime, it sounds like you'll need to use some kind of work around. Have you considered using the POST method to  upload the files, instead of using a URL? You can read more about the method in our documentation: https://crocodoc.com/docs/api/#doc-upload

713,"E102398626","Hi Randy, 

Thanks for reaching out. Original and converted documents are only stored in Moxie's S3 bucket, but document download requests are proxied through our servers. We use this proxy system to enforce our session-based security model, making sure that the only users who can access these files are the users you explicitly authorize through our API. It would be possible to have the original document downloads come directly from S3, but the trade-off would be that all document assets stored in S3 would be publicly viewable at all times to anyone with a direct download link, which we're assuming would not be a viable option given Moxie's emphasis on privacy and security. Please note that these options apply to both docviewer.js and the standard Crocodoc viewer. 

Does that help answer your question? I would be happy to elaborate or clarify, if that would help, and let me know if you'd like us to stop using the proxy system for downloads.

721,"E103325486","Hi Alexey, 

I think the problem is probably not your API token, but rather the request address itself. If you'd just like to play with the document in the Crocodoc viewer, I'd suggest starting with the API test console: https://crocodoc.com/docs/api-console/ 

If you're trying to test your code, I'd check out the 'upload' section of the API Reference: https://crocodoc.com/docs/api/#doc-upload. Are you trying to use the url method or the file method to upload? Multi-part POST requests can be a bit tricky, depending on what language you're using, so perhaps try using a direct url to the file to start. 

Let me know if I can clarify any of that, or if you have any other questions I can help answer.

Are you using a plugin? It's possible that the plugin only works with the previous version of our API -- to my knowledge, the only wordpress plugin was running on Crocodoc v1.

Yes, the docs need to be accessible for everything to work, but if you are concerned about security, I recommend that you generate ephemeral urls that expire after about 5 mins. As for your storage profile -- I just want to confirm that you want Crocodoc to store the documents, and not to use your S3 bucket. This transition is actually rather complex, so we want to be sure. If you do want to switch back to hosting on Crocodoc, will you still need your old documents?

Here are some answers!

1) 100 MB
2) Indefinitely (basically, until you delete it)
3) While you can't completely white label the viewer, you can add custom CSS.
4) We have a number of different options for this, which Ajoy (CC'd) can walk you through.
5) In production, white labeling of the viewer is possible. Also, depending on the plan you select, the rate limit of 2 simultaneous conversions may increase, custom storage options are possible, and text extraction becomes available. 
6) Because the library is still in development, we don't have a firm release date set yet, but I'd be happy to let you know once it's available.

Glad to hear you're using Crocodoc on your project! In order to upload files, you'll need to gather them from your users-  a form would work well for this. Once you have the documents, I'd recommend going through the API documentation here: https://crocodoc.com/docs/api/#doc-upload (and the documentation for the ruby gem you're using) in order to learn how to upload. The gem should be extremely helpful in simplifying that process. As for associating files with users/projects, there are many different ways to go about that, but I'd recommend figuring out a way to keep track of the UUIDs of the documents that each user uploads, so that when they want to open a document, you can generate a session to view it.

This is the blurb we used for an upcoming conference -- hopefully it helps! 

Peter Lai co-founded Crocodoc immediately after graduating from MIT in 2008. At Crocodoc, he leads development of technology that converts documents to cross-browser compatible HTML. Prior to Crocodoc, he worked on information retrieval at PARC and co-authored a patent on novel ways of searching collections of documents. He most enjoys pushing the limits of what is possible using the newest pre-release browsers. He least enjoys discovering that data URIs cause mixed content warnings in Internet Explorer 7.

While that's not a functionality that we support directly, for each document we convert, a unique UUID is assigned (which is then used to do things like creating sessions.)

Chris, 

Crocodoc’s pricing is based on number of documents converted to HTML5 (once a document has been converted, it can be viewed and annotated an unlimited number of times). 

A document can have as many pages as long as the file size isn't greater than 100 MB. 

We offer a starter plan that has a per-conversion fee of $0.10 ($0.15 for a white-label viewer) with a minimum of 1,500 conversions/month.

While we don't currently offer an on-premise version yet, we do offer on-premise storage integration with our SaaS version. 

The only files that Crocodoc stores are the intermediate files used to render documents in our HTML5 viewer. These converted files can be stored on your own S3 bucket or in a custom file store. Crocodoc does not keep your original document after it has been converted.

The main reason that most clients use their own S3 bucket involves meeting certain security requirements-- generally, their documents are particularly sensitive, and they prefer not to have a third party like Crocodoc own the storage at any point in the process. If you choose not to go with a custom storage service, Crocodoc handles the necessary storage for you. Does that help to clarify things?

There would not be a case where the document was 'DONE' but not viewable.

This does, however, occasionally lead to situations in which a document is viewable, but encounters an error later in the document and thus ends with a status of 'ERROR'. Does that make sense?

I sincerely apologize both for the delayed response and for the issue you continue to experience. After some investigation, it's become clear that the problem is more complex than we anticipated, and it seems unlikely that this will be resolved within the timeframe necessary for your client. 

We understand that this causes a significant issue for you and your client, and would like to take whatever steps we can to help you in the meantime. Not only would we like to offer you a refund for your WebNotes Pro subscription, but we'd be happy to get you set up with an account for our sister product, Crocodoc Personal, which will enable similar annotation of PDFs, if that would help. If Crocodoc Personal doesn't fit your needs, we may also be able to make some recommendations for other services with the capabilities you need. 


Again, I can't apologize enough for this critical error and the issues it is causing you. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.

All my best,

923,"E113004433","Hi Stefani, 

I'm so sorry to hear that Crocodoc Personal isn't going to fit your needs. I spent some time researching alternatives today, and unfortunately have not been able to find a web-based sticky note service with similar multicolored stickynotes to those offered in WebNotes. Using Crocodoc, you might consider having your different teams use brackets to identify themselves on their sticky notes, or perhaps assigning a specific highlighter color to each team. (I understand this is not ideal, but is the best option I can think of right now.)

That said, we deeply apologize for all the frustration and trouble this has caused you. As I should have mentioned before, WebNotes is no longer an actively supported product, so while we continue to operate it as-is, support and updates are significantly delayed. That said, we know we have a commitment to our customers and have clearly failed not only to communicate that change to you, but also to provide you with the support you needed at a sensitive time. As I mentioned, we will be crediting your card with a full refund, and if there is anything else I can do to help your situation at all, please let me know.

With sincerest apologies,

Zoelle

Hi Ajoy, 

Following our conversation, I'm sending you some details about our problem. 

We remind you that we have several plateforms that are using your solution. 
Each document is identified by an UUID. It seems that you are now using a different UUID with the V2
Please, if you can then : 
1) send us the list of all the documents that where uploaded during the V1
2) Give to each document of the list the new UUID that works with the V2
3) Send us the URL of the plateform from which the uploaded was done, so that we will be able to identify the name of the plateforme for each document as we only have one ID for all our plateforms.
Thank you. 

Best,

953,"E115773275","Hi Danielle,

Do you know if your users are trying to add annotations after keeping the documents open for longer than 60 minutes? We suspect it may have something to do with sessions expiring, as we can't find anything else going on with those particular documents that you've sent over. As for the document you're having trouble annotating at all, could you send me the original file?

Thanks!

953,"E115779718","Hi Danielle,

It's true that sessions expire after 60 minutes, and that annotations added after the session has expired will not be saved. Hopefully that will help! In the future, we're planning to introduce an option to set session times longer than 60 minutes, which will help with this issue, but for now, for security reasons, that's how long they last.

Thanks, and I look forward to hearing back from you re: the problematic file! It sounds like it's having trouble rendering in the first place, so if I can get a look at it, I should be able to tell.

Thanks, and have a great weekend!

If you're receiving a status of ""Error"", that means that there was an error in the conversion of the document itself, so you wouldn't necessarily return an error, as it's a problem on our side. If you send me the document you're having trouble with, I can take a look and see if there's an obvious reason why it's having trouble converting/see if we can get it working.

Unfortunately, the answer to your question may be a little frustrating. Because Crocodoc does not currently support interactive features in PDFs (which, unfortunately, include comments) and we save our comments as comments in the native PDF format when you download an annotated document, the comments won't be available if you re-upload the document to Crocodoc, even if it was initially annotated using Crocodoc.

I know this is incredibly frustrating, and I'll make sure the team is aware.

2) Perhaps look into how to change the source of the iframe based on whatever navigation interactions you plan to enable.

3) You can dynamically allow certain users the ability to edit and others only to view the document, so it would absolutely be possible to implement something like this. 

4) Our pricing is based on the number of document converted, and starts at pennies per document. Ajoy will be able to give you more information and help you find a plan that might be a good fit.

1015,"E116527393","Georg,

The only files that Crocodoc stores are the intermediate files used to render documents in our HTML5 viewer. If you're using Amazon S3, these converted files can be stored on your own S3 bucket or we can store them in a custom file store. Crocodoc does not keep your original document after it has been converted.

As Zoelle mentioned, our pricing is based on number of documents converted to HTML5 (once a document has been converted, it can be viewed and annotated an unlimited number of times). 

We offer a starter monthly subscription plan that has a per-conversion fee of $0.10 ($0.15 for a white-label viewer) with a minimum of 1,500 conversions/month.  

Would this option work for you?

Here's some more information about those failing links:

1) The document itself failed to download, so it never converted. This usually means the link to the location to download the original document was broken.
2 & 3) Could you try resubmitting these documents, or have your customer do so? They seem to have had a rare problem with gathering metadata that should be resolved by a re-upload (though if they don't succeed after re-upload, it indicates that there's something wrong with the structure of the PDFs, and we won't be able to convert them.)

Have you tried simply linking directly to the viewing session (ie the URL that you feed into the iframe to get the document to display?) If your objective is simply to remove the second scrollbar, and you don't require anything else to render on the page besides the document, that might be your best bet.

Crocodoc Personal runs off of an earlier version of our API than Crocodoc.com, so many of the errors you're seeing Crocodoc Personal have actually been resolved for Crocodoc.com and our API. If it's a huge priority for you that the document renders correctly on Personal, I can talk to the developers about trying to fix them for the earlier version of our API, but it wouldn't be trivial, and might take some time to implement. Please let me know either way.

I'd recommend listening to the pagechange event (as described under 'Events' in the docviewer.js documentation: https://crocodoc.com/docs/js/) and then using jQuery to determine how far the current page is from the top and thus when the page should snap to the top. If it helps, the ID of the page element is set to #Page{page number}.

Let me know if that helps, or if there's anything you need clarified.

Looks like we've gotten to the bottom of your problem! According to our logs, you have two accounts: cdomino and cdomino123. There were different issues with each of these accounts:

cdomino: It appears you tried to upload a number of unsupported filetypes, which would fail. We currently only support .pdf, .doc, .docx, .ppt, .pptx, .xls and .xlsx (in beta) so if you tried any other kinds you would have some trouble.
cdomino123: It looks as though you've tried to upload documents hosted on a local server (resition.local). If the URL of your document isn't publicly accessible, unfortunately you'll have to use a multi-part POST to send us the file (as described here in our API documentation:  https://crocodoc.com/docs/api/#doc-upload)

Currently, users can only change their passwords if they contact me, unfortunately.

If we don't receive a document in .pdf, .doc, .docx, .ppt, .pptx, .xls or .xls format, we won't be able to perform our conversion. Do you think you could walk me through a scenario that would use the script you describe, what exactly it would be using as inputs, and what the output would be? Thanks :)

Regardless, the document isn't publicly accessible, which means we can't convert it.

We're looking into why you're not receiving the error messages yourself, but hopefully in the meantime this helps.

Forgive my earlier misunderstanding. Could you do me a favor and check on the webhooks settings page (https://crocodoc.com/settings/webhook/) to see if you're still subscribed to document.status or annotation and comment updates? According to my system, you're not currently subscribed to either on either of your accounts, which would explain why you'd receive no payload.

Unfortunately, our API is designed for use on the server side, not the client side, so based on the title of your email, I'd guess that the problem is your attempt to use AJAX to initiate a session, which, as you discovered, isn't supported by our API. Since you're under some time pressure, I'd suggest you check out our API Libraries (just launched yesterday!) which may be able to substantially minimize the time necessary to get it working: https://crocodoc.com/docs/libraries/

Let me know if you have any other questions, or if you need any additional specific help to get it working.

No worries-- I can understand how you'd be confused. The ajax that you're seeing on our demo page is calling a custom web service that we created to wrap our API and get around cross-domain issues/keeps our API token from being exposed. If you'd like to use the code on the demo page, you'll need to create something similar.

Unfortunately, Crocodoc Personal uses a slightly older version of our API, which occasionally has rendering issues like the ones you saw. I've added that document to our test suite, and we'll do our best to address the issue as we continue to improve the conversion service.

I'm hoping you can help me out with a bit more information. We can see the issues that your customers are experiencing with the documents you've sent along, but we've been completely unable to replicate the problem in the browser/operating system. Do you think you could get me an exact step-by-step process followed after which these issues were experienced? For example, did the user zoom in at all and at what points, how fast were annotations added, did the user close the document and return to it, were these annotation problems initially visible or only after reopening the document, etc. I know that's a lot, but if I can't reproduce the problem, unfortunately I can't get it fixed!

I've never seen anything like this-- in fact, it looks like our website itself doesn't load right in Puffin. Very odd. The engineers tell me there's currently no way to force the mobile version to load, unfortunately.

Let me try to answer a few of your questions!

1) Our pricing is based on the number of conversions you have in a month. Usually there's a monthly minimum, with the price of a single conversion being only pennies. Depending on your needs and anticipated volumes, we can better let you know what the price might look like.

2) Take a look at the Docviewer.js documentation (https://crocodoc.com/docs/js-intro/) This javascript based viewer will give you the most control over the viewing experience. Let me know if you have any questions about it! I'd be happy to share more information or examples of docviewer in the wild.

Let me try to answer your questions:

1) While this has not yet been implemented for our iframe viewer and would be quite difficult to implement using docviewer.js, it's something we'd like to provide in the future, and it's good to know it would be useful for you. 

2) Using docviewer.js, you can specify which page number you'd like to start on (see our documentation for more details: https://crocodoc.com/docs/js/)

3) While you cannot disable individual tools in the annotation toolbar using our iframe viewer, in docviewer.js, you can build whichever commenting tools you want, meaning you could choose to only build a commenting tool and sidestep the others altogether.

4) An API method for returning the comments on a given document is in our pipeline, and should be available in the coming months.

We can store the converted files in a custom file store. Our most common integration is with Amazon S3 in which we store these files in a customer's own S3 bucket. Would this option work for you? ","2012-11-12 19:03:23","ajoy@crocodoc.com","y"

Please follow the instructions below for setting the permissions on your S3 bucket and then send me your bucket name so we can complete the integration.

S3 instructions:

To set up S3, you'll need to create a bucket that will house all the assets Crocodoc creates. Ideally, this bucket should start out empty and not be used for anything besides Crocodoc. IMPORTANT: When creating the bucket, make sure it's name contains nothing but lower-case letters, numbers, and hyphens.

Once this bucket is created, you'll need to grant our AWS account full permissions (List, Upload/Delete, View Permissions, Edit Permissions) on the bucket. Our AWS account is identified by my admin@crocodoc.com; so that's what should go in the ""Grantee"" field if you're using the AWS web console to set this up.","2012-11-14 21:39:18","ajoy@crocodoc.com","y"

I'd need to be able to reproduce the issue here at the office, which I've been unable to do. The only other thing I can think that might be going on is that perhaps you're closing the document too quickly after adding a comment- depending on your internet connection speed, it may take a bit for a comment to reach our system and be saved, so if you're navigating away before the comment has time to save, it might disappear.

A few follow-up questions:

1) Do you know if your users might be trying to add annotations after having the document open for longer than 60 minutes in their browser? We use session-based browsing, so if they're attempting to add annotations after the session has expired, they might encounter that problem. 
2) Could you provide me with access to your platform and a sample document where these issues can be reproduced? I need to reproduce the problem here in the office so I can determine what's wrong.

1276,"E127850092","Hi Elizabeth,

Sessions currently expire after 60 minutes of being created, so in your case, that's likely 60 minutes from the time the document is opened. We have recently introduced the ability to extend session length for certain customers who are less concerned with security, though, so if you think you'd prefer to have a longer session length, I can help you get that set up.

To address your other questions: 

a) There are a few reasons that Crocodoc might return an error like that, though session expiration sounds like the most likely candidate. I do agree with you -- our error messages could be clearer. We're working internally to fix this.

b) The only other situations in which annotations have been lost (that have come to my attention, at least) have occurred due to slow or intermittent internet connections. Essentially, if the user adds annotation and then navigates away from the page before the annotation is able to save to our server (which is usually instantaneous, but can be slowed down by a poor internet connection), it will not be saved (and we won't get an error log, because we would not ever receive notice of the attempt to add an annotation.) This almost never happens in the United States, but we've seen it occasionally overseas.

c) As I mentioned, sessions last 60 minutes from when they are created. What that means for your application sort of depends on how your developers chose to integrate our service, but it's likely that sessions are created when a person opens a document.

d) See b :)

A session lasts 60 minutes from the time you open the document. Each time you open the document, a new session is created.

Otherwise, you'd have to ask your team how they've set up the integration-- if they've made it so that every time a document is opened a new session is created, then refreshing should probably work, but they may have it set up differently.

Yes, we can store converted document files in your S3 bucket. If you have created an evaluation account, we can link your S3 bucket to your account. Please follow the instructions below for setting the permissions on your bucket and then send me your bucket name and the username of your evaluation account.

Let me know if you have any other questions.


S3 instructions:

To set up S3, you'll need to create a bucket that will house all the assets Crocodoc creates. Ideally, this bucket should start out empty and not be used for anything besides Crocodoc. IMPORTANT: When creating the bucket, make sure it's name contains nothing but lower-case letters, numbers, and hyphens.

Once this bucket is created, you'll need to grant our AWS account full permissions (List, Upload/Delete, View Permissions, Edit Permissions) on the bucket. Our AWS account is identified by my admin@crocodoc.com; so that's what should go in the ""Grantee"" field if you're using the AWS web console to set this up.","2012-11-29 06:10:08","ajoy@crocodoc.com","y"

Looks like the problem with those new documents is that we are unable to process one of the included fonts in the document at the moment. This is an extremely rare issue (I've only seen it once before, actually) but basically as a result we're unable to convert the document. I'm not sure if that will be super helpful to your user, but if they're using any obscure or custom fonts, and have some alternative, they may be more successful. I've passed this along to Peter, so he knows it's an issue, and will be sure to use this document in his test suite going forward.

As for the iPad problem, it looks like the issue in this case is the extremely large background images in that particular document. Each page has a huge background image that for some reason isn't loading.

1376,"E135143045","Hi Kevin, 

I'm so sorry for the delayed response! I tried to call you, but perhaps this is a better way to get started. I'm trying to understand the exact nature of the trouble you're encountering. Have you been able to successfully upload and view any documents using our API yet? 

I know you're first receiving a UUID and then an error message, which is frustrating, but unfortunately, at present we generate a UUID for any document that is uploaded, regardless of whether it will ultimately successfully convert (the uuid is created prior to any conversion attempt) which is why you're receiving a UUID but then encountering an error. We know that our error reporting is not as detailed or useful as it could be, so I'm sorry for any frustration the lack of error information may have caused- we're working on it! 

Generally speaking, within the category of documents that are a filetype we support (.pdf, .doc, .docx, .ppt, .pptx, .xls, .xlsx) the incidence of failure to convert is very low. If you send along the original document (which I couldn't seem to access at the url you provided) I can take a look and see what the root cause of the problem might have been. Otherwise, I'd like to briefly chat with you just to determine if the problem is something with the way your system is interacting with our API, or with the document itself. If you're having trouble viewing it in our API Test Console, it seems likely the problem has something to do with the document or link you're providing, but with a few other details I should be able to tell for sure.

Thanks for any additional information you can provide to help debug the situation, and I appreciate your patience as we get you up and running!

You're right- unfortunately, we do not currently support interactive fields. It's definitely something we hope to address in the future, but in the meantime, if a user uploads the document, they can use our text box annotation feature to fill in fields. Obviously that's not ideal, as if they've already filled it out on their computer they're just redoing work, but for now, it's a temporary solution.

According to my system, there was no problem converting the document with that UUID.

Do you think you could get me the original document, as well as the browser and operating system being used?

Let me do a little digging to figure out your first question. As for the second, it's sort of up to you how you'd like to go about it. We might suggest setting up a lazy loading system to only convert user documents if they're requested, but it really depends on the volume of documents and how your application works.

If we're storing the files for you (which is not a requirement - we offer integration with S3 if that's preferable) you shouldn't have to store the original documents. Converted documents can be a little tricky to understand: as far as storage is concerned, we store the assets necessary to create the document in html in the browser (so you wouldn't just see a single .html file for each documents in your S3 bucket- you'd see a number of different assets, for cross-browser compatibility reasons.) 

Have you read through our walkthroughs? You can find the basic embed-a-document walkthrough here: https://crocodoc.com/docs/walkthrough/embed/ In combination with the documentation for the Ruby gem, hopefully it should be relatively straightforward to implement, but let me know if there's anything else I can do to help clarify.

I'm so sorry for the inconvenience! This is a bug we're aware of with citations that are auto-generated by Microsoft Word, and we're working to resolve it. Unfortunately, it's quite complicated, which means it could take a while to fix it. At this point, I don't have an ETA for resolution that I can share with you, but I'll be sure to let you know as soon as we get it working. 

I'm glad to hear that the PDFs aren't being affected, though. As we continue to move towards a resolution on this issue, perhaps the students could save the works cited page separately in PDF format? Obviously that's not ideal, but at least that way they have some proof of their work being complete? 

I know that's not the most satisfying answer, and your users must be very frustrated, but we appreciate your bringing the issue to our attention and we're doing everything we can to get it resolved as quickly as possible.

Let me try to answer your questions: 

1) Yes! That's documented as a parameter ('downloadable') that you can use when creating a session. You can read more in our API documentation: https://crocodoc.com/docs/api/#session-create

Sorry for the delayed response. Here are some answers to your questions:

1) The documents are rendered as HTML, not as an image, so they would not be able to save the entire document as an image. They would be able to print screen or otherwise use screen capture to keep copies, but there's not really much we would be able to do to stop that.

2) Our pricing plan is based on the number of documents you upload in a month. Our lowest pricing plan starts at $50 for 500 documents, but there are other pricing plans based on higher volumes. My colleague Ajoy (cc'ed) can walk you through them. A ""document conversion"" refers to any document that you upload to Crocodoc (which is then converted into HTML so it can be viewed in the browser.)

1419,"E137414732","Hi Peter,

We recently implemented a custom session length parameter, though we're leaving it undocumented for now. In the meantime, however, I've included information for how you can use it below.

When making an API call to create a session, users can now add a ""duration"" parameter to specify the number of seconds the session should be valid.  This can range from 0 seconds (meaning the session would expire immediately... not very useful) to ~50 years (1576800000 seconds).  

Here's a simple example request to make a session that would last 24 hours (86400 seconds):

curl 'https://crocodoc.com/api/v2/session/create' --data 'token=api_token&uuid=doc_uuid&duration=86400'

Highlighting is not currently available on mobile, so it's not surprising that you can't do that quite yet, though I'm sorry for the inconvenience! As for comments, you should be able to edit them by simply tapping the comment itself.

1452,"E139338922","Hi Eros, 

Forgive me if this is a silly question, but when the comment bubble appears, are you tapping on the bubble itself? If you do so, a cursor should appear, as well as the keyboard, and you should be able to write text. You do have to tap on the empty comment first in order to do this, however. Once you're done, you simply need to tap outside the comment bubble to indicate that you're done. If you'd like to add another comment, you can then tap elsewhere on the document and repeat the process. There is occasionally a slight lag between when you tap the screen and when the cursor appears, so wait a second or two after tapping the bubble to see if that might be the issue.

Let me know if that still doesn't work, and I'll see if I can reproduce the issue, as it appears to be working over here.

Thanks for your patience, and we'll get this working soon!

That's definitely a problem! Let me take a look and see what's going on there. Right now, it looks like the font being used doesn't actually have the em dash character being used, and so it's not rendering when we convert it into HTML, but I'm going to keep digging and make sure that's actually what's going on.

There is a Drupal module available from a third-party here: https://github.com/prince-mishra/crocodoc that should make implementation easy. Perhaps that would help? You can use it to programmatically generate new sessions each time a person opens up your newsletter, so if they were to figure out how to find the URL to the content and to share the URL to your newsletter with other people, it would expire after an hour, which should help to stop the spreading of your content without your permission. In the module, there should be a way to disable downloads.

Let me try to answer your question:

1) Could you clarify what you mean by this? Each upload receives a unique UUID, so (if I'm understanding correctly) perhaps there's a way to save and associate those UUIDs with specific users on your end? But I fear I may not completely understand what you have in mind, so any clarification would be helpful.
2) You can check out our webhooks documentation to learn more about the different events: https://crocodoc.com/docs/webhooks/ but at a high level, annotation and comment events are triggered when users create, edit, or delete annotations and comments while viewing a document. Event types follow the form annotation.* and comment.* for annotations and comments respectively where * is one of create, update, or delete.
3) Currently this feature is not available, but it's definitely on the list and I'll let you know as soon as it's available.
4) Could you send me some code to take a look at and/or a sample document where you experienced this behavior? I need to replicate it on my end or at least gather a bit more information so I can diagnose what's going on.

Answers below, marked with "">>""

1) I was thinking that because MindTap is a platform, there will be multiple instances running at any one time for multiple classes with multiple sections. The use case I was thinking of here was being able to distinguish upload 1 by professor A vs. upload 2 by professor B.

We could certainly handle this on our end, just wanted to verify if it was not something that was already supported (tags?)

>> Unfortunately, this isn't currently supported, though we've heard a few requests for tags, and it's good to know that this would be useful for you.

2) Yup, I saw this after I sent the questions, that should work for us. Thanks!

>>Glad to hear it!

3) OK, well that would be an awesome feature, but it is not a show stopper. It would probably implemented on our end with the implementation of the answer to question #1.

>> I'll let you know when this feature is available, though i imagine you'll have something else in place at that point.

4) Sure. What I'm using is attached. Also you can see the behavior here with the attached PDF:
http://cengagecrock.aws.af.cm/upload.php

Steps to reproduce:

1. open the URL
2. Make sure the console is visible for debugging
3. Upload the PDF (Team_Sandler.pdf)
4. Check the console output, notice that the UUID and other data is not being passed.
5. Upload second pdf (Preface.pdf)
6. Check the console output, notice that the UUID and other data are being passed.

I'm sure it is not something stupid I'm doing on my end, so a fresh set of eyes probably helps. This is only happening when I deploy it to the address above. I am having not issues when I run from my local box.

>> Have you changed the maximum upload size in your configuration files? According to one of my developers, the default maximum is 2 MB, which would explain why files that are 1.9 MB work, but files that 2.1 MB do not. 

5) ""errors"":""server_error_400_bad_request Crocodoc: [server_error_400_bad_request] Crocodoc::_request\r\n\r\n{\""url\"":\""https:\\\/\\\/crocodoc.com\\\/api\\\/v2\\\/download\\\/thumbnail?uuid=6b2273d2-51ec-4de3-9844-4938c6d2b651&token=AbWKon8RQIMyZPXDxh4t1FsB\"",\""getParams\"":\""uuid=6b2273d2-51ec-4de3-9844-4938c6d2b651&token=AbWKon8RQIMyZPXDxh4t1FsB\"",\""postParams\"":null}""}

If I copy the url from that response, I do get the correct thumbnail.

I'm using PHP to access:
CrocodocDownload::thumbnail($uuid);

Not sure what I'm doing wrong. Does it have anything to do with ""postParams"" being null? If so, how do I fix that?

>> The postParams being null shouldn't cause a problem (that's just indicating that you didn't pass in a desired height/width. Have you tried including those parameters to see if that works? Whether or not that works might help me diagnose what's going on.

1511,"E142810661","Hi Tim, 

As you've discovered, Crocodoc only works server-side, not client-side, so AJAX requests unfortunately are unsupported. This is primarily for cross-domain issues. The only way you'd be able to use AJAX without exposing your API token (which we really strongly suggest you avoid doing) would be to use a custom web service to wrap the API and get around cross-domain issues/keep your API token from being exposed, but that's relatively complex and can take a long time to implement correctly.

When this HTML is inserted into the DOM with jQuery's append/html methods, the scripts are not evaluated in the same way they would normally be (or even the correct order). To ensure the scripts are loaded in the correct order, you should actually use jQuery's built-in $.getScript() method from the page making the AJAX request to load the ""//crocodoc.com/webservice/document.js?session=<session_id>"" script. The ""//static-v2.crocodoc.com/core/docviewer.js"" script can be included in the requesting page (in the head or body using <script> tag). It only needs to be loaded once. The important part is that these two Crocodoc scripts are loaded BEFORE you try to call new DocViewer();

Unfortunately, using multiple instances of docviewer in a page is not currently possible due to an issue with ID collisions. We  are aware of this problem and are working to resolve it in the coming months. There will be an announcement when it's fixed, and I'll be sure to let you know as well, but for now, unfortunately we can only support one instance of docviewer per page.

Something about the way the ppt was saved caused some problems in the way it was processed. When I downloaded the file and resaved it on my own computer (without making any changes to the presentation itself), it was able to upload and display fine.

Yes, I can reproduce the problem if I try to upload the original document to Crocodoc, but if I open the powerpoint on my computer and then resave it without making any changes, it successfully uploads to Crocodoc.

This means that the problem happened when the user initially saved the document. I can send you the version that works, if you'd like to upload it for your user. Let me know if you'd like me to do so.

1523,"E146929097","Hi Julio,

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. What I am able to reproduce is the original document not being able to show a preview in the Crocodoc viewer. Once the document is resaved, the document is able to preview in the Crocodoc viewer. This means that the document was corrupted during its initial saving, which would not prevent the document from being able to be opened in Microsoft Office, but would stop the document from being able to preview in Crocodoc. If that's an accurate description, this is an extremely rare problem (I've only seen it once before) and it is deliberate that the API does not work with the corrupted document. 

Is that a correct description? I just want to make sure we're on the same page.

Are you referring to the Crocodoc API or Crocodoc Personal? If you're referring to the API, public accessibility would be determined by the way you chose to integrate Crocodoc into your website. If you mean Crocodoc Personal, then the only way that documents can be made publicly available is by sharing the links to the documents publicly. Crocodoc does not release documents to the public and they are not indexed by search engines. Does that help to answer your question?

It turns out that you're seeing this problem because of a font processing issue on our end. We've added your example documents to our test suite of documents, and are working to resolve the issue, but I can't give you an exact ETA- based on what I'm hearing from the engineering team, it sounds like this issue will be resolved in major update we have coming in a few months, but it's possible they may be resolved slightly sooner. I'll keep an eye on this issue, and let you know as soon as it's resolved.

I took a look again, and it appears that while we successfully received payment for the most recent invoice (#12268) and the invoice sent in November (#12105), the payment failed for invoice number #12177 (sent in December.)

After a doc is loaded, if you want to load a different doc, you can do this:


var url = '//crocodoc.com/webservice/document.js?session=NEW_DOC_SESSION_ID';
$.getScript(url,  function () {
    $('#DocViewer').html('');
    docViewer = new DocViewer({ ""id"": ""DocViewer"" });

It looks like you did successfully make an account on Crocodoc personal, but unfortunately, I don't think that will help you be able to login to the website you mentioned above.

Thanks for bringing this to our attention! We were able to reproduce and isolate the bug (basically, the container for the text was too small), and fortunately, it's one that will be addressed by the major update we have coming in a few months. 

On a related note, we thought this particular document was really well designed and visually appealing (especially in the new version that we'll be releasing soon.) We like to highlight particularly great documents that take full advantage of our technology (ie, aren't entirely comprised of images) and were wondering if you might be open to our using this document as a sample when we announce the new viewer. No worries if not, but is there any chance that you'd be OK with that (with full attribution, of course)?

1692,"E155761463","Hi Frank!

I have both good news and bad news for you. The good news is that there are great ways to use AJAX in conjunction with Crocodoc's API; the bad news is that the way you're currently attempting to do so probably isn't going to work. 

Unfortunately, because of the way our API is designed, sessions must be created on the server side (or else you not only run into the cross domain issues you're experiencing, but you also likely end up exposing your API token, which is very, very bad.)

Is it a requirement that you use AJAX to create sessions? We may be able to figure out some other way of making this work for you, if so.

1692,"E155853896","Hi Frank,

A few things: at a high level, you're absolutely right that you'd likely need to either change your approach to incorporating our Java Library, or write a .NET library. (Side note: If you do decide to write a .NET library,  and are interested in open-sourcing your work, please let us know! We highlight 3rd party libraries on our website and .NET is maybe the most requested that we don't have yet.) On a more technical note, however, we do have an undocumented method that I can share with you to set the session length to whatever length you want (to substantially more or even less than 60 minutes.) If that would help you in the interim, I would be happy to share that with you.

1695,"E155762956","Hi Daniel,

That would absolutely be possible using our system! In fact, that's one of the primary ways that many of our current customers use Crocodoc. Our pricing is based on the number of documents that you upload, and is generally pennies per document (with the price per document decreasing at higher volumes.) Do you have a sense of how many documents per month you would be uploading, roughly? 

As for using your own servers, while we don't currently offer an on-premise integration, we do have custom storage options that allow you to store both the original files and the intermediate assets necessary to generate the HTML in your own Amazon S3 bucket. Would that work for you?

Thanks so much,

1695,"E156739219","Hi Daniel,

My colleague Ajoy (cc'ed) will be able to help answer your pricing question, but to give you a general idea, our price is based on the number of documents converted per month, with an introductory level plan starting at a monthly minimum of 500 documents at 10 cents a document ($50/month). There are discounts available based on volume, however. Do you have a sense of how many documents you would be converting per month?

As for your other questions:

1) We can convert PDF, .doc/.docx, .ppt/.pptx, .xls/.xlsx files
2) Documents are generally viewable to users within 1-2 seconds
3) No, it is currently not possible to create documents in our system, only to preview them.

Here are some answers for your questions!

1) 20 MB
2) Crocodoc supports PDFs, Microsoft Word documents, PowerPoint documents, PNG and JPEG images.
3) Your documents should not be indexed by Google. Individuals will only be able to access them if you provide them with the direct link.
4) I'll be sure to let the team know that this would be a useful tweak for you, and we'll see if it makes sense to implement in the future. Thanks for the feedback!

Currently, we don't have full support for the font pack that your document was written in, which is why it's not rendering correctly.

1811,"E162787350","Hi Sander, 

You can read more about this in our documentation (https://crocodoc.com/docs/api/#doc-status) but there should be a response property called ""error"" that should tell you what's going on: 

Response properties

The response to a valid status request contains an array of objects; one for each requested document. Each object has the following properties:

uuid - The document's uuid.
status - Current state of the document. Possible values (described below) include QUEUED, PROCESSING, DONE, ERROR.
Document status guide:

QUEUED - document conversion has not yet begun
PROCESSING - document conversion is in process
DONE - the document was successfully converted
ERROR - an error has occurred during document conversion
viewable - Indicates if the document is available for viewing.
error - Only exists if the document's status is ERROR. Provides a short explanation of why the document conversion failed. Some reasons a document may fail to convert include the file being corrupt, password-protected, or too large to process.
Sample response:

[ {
    ""uuid"": ""7cf917de-2246-4ac3-adab-791a49454180"",
    ""status"": ""DONE"",
    ""viewable"": true
  },
  {
    ""uuid"": ""6faad04f-5409-4173-87aa-97c1fd1f35ad"",
    ""status"": ""ERROR"",
    ""viewable"": false,
    ""error"": ""password protected""
  } ]

When you look at the error property for that document, what do you see?

Thanks!

1811,"E164780699","Hi Sander,

Unfortunately, we don't always provide an error message, even if an error HAS occurred. We're in the process of updating our error messages to be more useful (and to include some kind of message in all cases.) I know that our documentation really doesn't make this clear, and we'll be updating that as an interim improvement. This particular document is running into some problems based on the fonts it includes. If you send me a copy of the original document, I'd love to add it to our document test suite so we can use it to improve our conversion engine moving forward.

Unfortunately, I don't currently have an ETA on when real-time annotations will be available again. It's a complicated issue on our end for a few reasons, so we're holding off on re-implementation until we can do it right. I know this is really frustrating, and I'm so sorry for the inconvenience.

1871,"E164775613","Hi Joey,

You're running into this problem because document sessions have a standard length of 60 minutes, so the links expire after that time. What kind of app are you trying to embed the document viewer into? We have some pretty straightforward API libraries that would be a good place to start: crocodoc.com/docs/libraries or I might be able to help you figure out what to do, if you can be more specific about your needs!

1871,"E166228754","Hi Joey,

Here's some information on how to set a custom session length:

When making an API call to create a session, users can now add a ""duration"" parameter to specify the number of seconds the session should be valid.  This can range from 0 seconds (meaning the session would expire immediately... not very useful) to ~50 years (1576800000 seconds).  

Here's a simple example request to make a session that would last 24 hours (86400 seconds):

curl 'https://crocodoc.com/api/v2/session/create' --data 'token=api_token&uuid=doc_uuid&duration=86400'

While you can't save one of our annotated documents as a jpeg, there are programs you can use on your computer to save a pdf as a jpeg (or your students could try taking a screenshot of the documents.) I know that isn't the easiest solution, and I'll be sure to let the team know that an option to save as a jpeg would be useful for you, but I hope it can work in the meantime!

Currently, we don't have a queue set up on our end, so you'll need to resubmit those documents that go over the rate limit. You can keep track of how many documents you're currently processing by keeping track of the document status (https://crocodoc.com/docs/api/#doc-status) One a document's status is ""DONE"" or ""ERROR"" it no longer counts as processing, so you should be able to tell how many documents you have with status 'QUEUED' or 'PROCESSING'.

2169,"E181209659","Hi Thananjeyan,

I hope all is well! Unfortunately, in the current version of our viewer there is no way to disable specific toolbar functionality. However, we know that may of our users would like that option, and we're definitely considering including it in our upcoming version! In the meantime, if you have the resources to build the annotation tools that you want, you might consider checking out docviewer.js. It doesn't come with a toolbar of any kind, so you would have to implement a lot of functionality yourself, but it does provide the level of customization that you need.

Thanks for the feedback, and let me know if you have any other questions!

2218,"E183315640","Hi there,

Here are some instructions for setting up your S3 bucket! Once you've done this, just send me your bucket name so we can do the integration on our end.


S3 instructions:

To set up S3, you'll need to create a bucket that will house all the assets Crocodoc creates. Ideally, this bucket should start out empty and not be used for anything besides Crocodoc. IMPORTANT: When creating the bucket, make sure it's name contains nothing but lower-case letters, numbers, and hyphens.

Once this bucket is created, you'll need to grant our AWS account full permissions (List, Upload/Delete, View Permissions, Edit Permissions) on the bucket. Our AWS account is identified by my admin@crocodoc.com; so that's what should go in the ""Grantee"" field if you're using the AWS web console to set this up.

It looks like the problem here is related to the way we map unicode characters to the glyphs in the font being used in that PDF. I have passed this document along to our developers so we can fix this issue going forward. In the meantime, if you save the affected pages as images (and then again as a PDF) you should be able to get them to display correctly. It's not a great work around, but if that document is really important, it should help temporarily.

My apologies for the inconvenience, and please let me know if you run into any other problematic documents!

The first option seems feasible but possibly complicated. Because we're in the process of moving over to the new viewer, the second option isn't something we can currently or support. Number three is the most feasible, but I can't yet provide a timeline for its availability, unfortunately, except to say it will be some time in the coming months. I know that's frustrating, but I'll make sure you're informed as soon as I can provide an ETA for the new version. Good news, though, is that the new version will continue to support all the browsers that the current version supports now.

We're aware that this can sometimes be a problem, and we're so sorry for the inconvenience! For now, the best way to verify that a comment has saved is to click outside of of the comment (anywhere else on the page) before closing the document. Usually, failure for comments to save has to do with people closing the document before the comment information has time to reach our servers and be saved. This is particularly true if you're working on a relatively slow internet connection.

2380,"E191090604","Hi Rodrigo,

Are you using the iFrame or docviewer.js viewer? What type of watermark do you want? One with text or an image?

Thanks,

Zoelle ","2013-04-17 23:57:49","zoelle@crocodoc.com","y"
2380,"E193891283","Rodrigo, 

Creating a watermark for the iFrame will be relatively difficult, and will basically require superimposing a layer containing the translucent watermark text on top of the iFrame so that it appears on top of the document. It will not actually add a watermark to the document itself, so if you are planning to allow your users to download the document, the watermark will not appear. It will also inhibit text selection, so if you are planning to use annotations, this solution will not be compatible.

If you think this will still work, here's some CSS you could use to create that layer over the iframe: 

 iframe::after {
       content: 'watermark';
       display: block;
       position: relative;
       bottom: 200px;
       left: 50px;
       width: 100px;
       height: 100px;
       color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
       font-size: 80px;
   }

If you're open to using docviewer.js, it will be a bit easier. If you'd like to add it on each page, you can use CSS like this: 

.page-outer::after {
       content: 'watermark';
       display: block;
       position: relative;
       bottom: 200px;
       left: 50px;
       width: 100px;
       height: 100px;
       color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
       font-size: 80px;
   }

If you would prefer to put it over the whole viewer, like in the iframe version, you could use a variation on this: 

.docviewer::after {
       content: 'watermark';
       display: block;
       position: absolute;
       bottom: 200px;
       left: 50px;
       width: 100px;
       height: 100px;
       color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
       font-size: 80px;

It looks like the problem here lies in the way we map unicode characters to the original font. If characters are missing in that font, we then accidentally present the wrong character.

2442,"E194509838","Hi Joel,

All documents should still be compatible with IE7. Is the document in question particularly large, or does it have a number of large background images? Because we use a legacy fallback to support IE7 which relies heavily on rasterization, often there will be a change in performance for IE7 when there a large number of pictures or complicated layouts/fonts. In general, however, you should still be able to open documents in all supported browsers.

Unfortunately, we do not currently support multiple instances of Docviewer on the same page, though you can create multiple instances of our iFrame viewer. In the new version of Crocodoc that we'll be releasing in the coming months, we will provide support for multiple instances of Docviewer, as this is a regularly requested feature.

2491,"E197490320","Hi Jack,

Our sessions are set to expire after 60 minutes by default.

Here's some information on how to create a custom session length?

When making an API call to create a session, users can now add a ""duration"" parameter to specify the number of seconds the session should be valid. This can range from 0 seconds (meaning the session would expire immediately... not very useful) to ~50 years (1576800000 seconds). 

Here's a simple example request to make a session that would last 24 hours (86400 seconds):

curl 'https://crocodoc.com/api/v2/session/create' --data 'token=api_token&uuid=doc_uuid&duration=86400'


Thanks, and let me know if you have any other questions,

Glad to hear you're liking the new version of the API so far! Unfortunately, the option to download the HTML is only available in that new version, which has not been released for production use yet, so while that feature will absolutely be available for commercial accounts once it's launched, you can't use it quite yet. I don't have an ETA that I can share with you for the release of the new version, but as soon as that's available, I'll make sure you're among the first to know! As for your second question, while we don't have anything formal built to do that, it would be relatively easy to achieve something similar using our API. As for pricing, currently it's based on the number of documents uploaded in a given month. It sounds like the new version would be necessary for your needs, so I'd be happy to send over pricing once it's available!

2543,"E202650743","Hi Judi,

Our system is session-based, so when a user that has logged into your system wishes to view a document, you would initiate a session which would generate an expiring URL with a default session-length of 60 minutes (though you could customize that time.) Were the person to go into the iframe viewer and find the URL to the document, it would only be visible until the end of the session, which dramatically limits its ability to be shared. Furthermore, the URLs generated are non-guessable, so someone would have to already have access to your site in order to find the URL in the first place. All this to say, while we don't currently add additional password or IP address protection onto our product, because of the way it's constructed, as long as your site is adequately protected, you shouldn't have to worry about people being able to share the documents outside your system.

Does that make sense?

When you download an annotated document, we convert our annotations to native PDF annotations.

Looks like for FF the iframe would need to be visible on load to get it to work with Crocodoc, unfortunately. However, it looks like it works fine if you create a session using our API. We have an undocumented feature that allows you to set session length, so you could very easily create a 100 year session (or whatever length you wanted) and use that in your iFrame. I'd be happy to help you get that set up (or create some essentially permanent sessions for you, depending on how many you need) if you'd like. You can generate a 60 minute session to test this out here: https://crocodoc.com/see-it-in-action/upload/. Just take the link from the iFrame generated on that page and put it into the iFrame, and if my tests are correct, it should work! Let me know if that works, or if there's anything else I can do.

Here's some sample code for creating a fullscreen button to use in conjunction with our iFrame viewer:

button.addEventListener('click', function () { goFullscreen(iframe); }, true);

Fullscreen functions needed:

// this function will make an element passed as argument fullscreen
// must be called in direct reaction to user input (eg. a click event)
function goFullscreen(el) {
    if (fullscreenIsSupported()) {
        return el.mozRequestFullScreen && el.mozRequestFullScreen() ||
            el.webkitRequestFullScreen && el.webkitRequestFullScreen() ||
            el.requestFullScreen && el.requestFullScreen() ||
            el.requestFullscreen && el.requestFullscreen();
    } else {
        throw new Error('Fullscreen is not supported');
    }
}

// test support for fullscreen
function fullscreenIsSupported() {
    return document.body.mozRequestFullScreen ||
        document.body.webkitRequestFullScreen ||
        document.body.requestFullScreen ||
        document.body.requestFullscreen;
}

This example should work in Chrome (15+), Safari (5.1+), Firefox (10+),  and Opera (12.1+). I tested in the latest versions of these browsers (Mac and Windows). Note: no version of IE currently supports the Fullscreen API, so the best you can do there is position the iframe (absolute or fixed), with a width and height: 100%, top and left: 0. 

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything I can do to help clarify.

Crocodoc pricing is based on the number of documents you upload in a month. Our pricing starts at $50 for a monthly minimum of 500 documents. Any additional documents uploaded are prorated to $0.10/document. Do you have a sense of how many documents you'll be uploading in a given month? Would that pricing work for you? I've CC'ed my colleague Christian, who will be able to help you out with further pricing questions.

It looks like you're trying to use our V1 API methods, which have been deprecated. In order to use our API now, you'll need to switch over to V2 and sign up for a free developer account at https://crocodoc.com/get-started/. Once you've successfully logged in, you'll find a new API token on your dashboard (https://crocodoc.com/dashboard). You can find all the current API methods at https://crocodoc.com/docs/. You might also find our API libraries helpful (https://crocodoc.com/docs/libraries) - we offer libraries for Java, PHP, Python and Ruby, as well as 3rd party libraries for additional languages.

While currently you cannot use the embedded viewer without session creation, we do have an undocumented method for setting the session length for more than 60 minutes, so that you can essentially create non-expiring sessions: 

You can add a ""duration"" parameter to specify the number of seconds the session should be valid. This can range from 0 seconds (meaning the session would expire immediately... not very useful) to ~50 years (1576800000 seconds).  

Here's a simple example request to make a session that would last 24 hours (86400 seconds):

curl 'https://crocodoc.com/api/v2/session/create' --data 'token=api_token&uuid=doc_uuid&duration=86400'

Answers to your questions below: 

1. As long as you properly store document uuids, it should be fine to rely on the  documents we store. Keep in mind that if a document conversion fails, we don't make the document available for retrieval, so you should at least maintain a copy until you've ensured that the Crocodoc conversion succeeded.

2. We store a collection of assets (HTML, JS, CSS, fonts, etc) for each document, but the actual structure/layout of said files is subject to change and should not be relied on, so that bucket should be dedicated to Crocodoc assets only.

3. Nope! You can use it as documented.

Apparently, we don't actually have access to any of your AWS keys currently- we instead have bucket owners grant us admin access to the buckets and then generate our own keys. Therefore, I don't think this question would necessarily be applicable for our integration. Does that make sense?

As long as the files are publicly available URLs or you're able to POST them to us, that should be fine.

Glad to hear you like Crocodoc! If you want to be able to use Crocodoc's functionality on an image, perhaps consider saving it as a PDF first before uploading to Crocodoc- that way, you'll be able to annotate and download as normal.

Thanks!

Have you checked out our Python API library? It might be helpful: https://github.com/crocodoc/crocodoc-python Otherwise, I'd need to see either your live site or the code you're using to upload the document and then to request the status so I can see what's going wrong with how the UUID is being captured.

Thanks for reaching out! Crocodoc converts office and PDF documents into HTML so they can be viewed in any device and any browser. If that sounds like a product that could be useful for you, you can learn more at https://crocodoc.com/why-crocodoc/

2862,"E211785129","Hi Sally,

It sounds like you've encountered one of the small number of documents that Crocodoc is unable to convert. Our Excel conversion technology is currently in beta, so you'll see a higher incidence of errors like this when trying to upload Excel documents. In particular, if you have a lot of macros or a large dataset, you're likely to run into trouble. If you'd like to send the document to us, we can take a look to see what the issue might be, and we'll use the document to improve our conversion engine going forward. Otherwise, I apologize for the inconvenience, and please let me know if you run into any other problematic documents!

It's possible that the issue is caused by the Chinese characters, though it's hard to say exactly what the cause of the problem might be without access to the original document. We do occasionally run into trouble converting Chinese characters, though we're working to improve our support for extended and other language character sets. Sorry for the inconvenience!

Currently, we do not offer on-premise conversion services, so you would need to have the ability to proxy through our servers in order to convert the documents to HTML. We do also offer custom storage integrations with Amazon S3. If this would meet your needs, we offer plans starting at $50/month for a minimum of 500 documents uploaded. Would that fit your needs?

Thanks for your interest in Crocodoc! Have you taken a look at our API? Basically, using it you'll be able to upload a PDF, receive a unique ID for the document, and then use that ID to generate on-demand sessions for viewing the converted HTML document, which you can embed in your site using either an iFrame or our Javascript based viewer. A good place to get started looking at our API might be our walkthroughs and documentation (https://crocodoc.com/docs/) or our API libraries (http://crocodoc.com/docs/libraries) which simplify the development process substantially: 

As for pricing, it really depends on the volume of documents you anticipate uploading. Our starter plan is currently $50 for up to 500 documents/month, with additional documents pro-rated at $0.10/document. Would that work for your needs? I've cc'ed my colleague Christian, who will be able to follow up with you regarding additional pricing questions you might have.

It looks like you're actually using HTML generated by preview.crocodoc.com, which is not currently available for production and is not intended to be used until it is properly released (which is why it isn't working in IE8, which doesn't support SVG.)

Thanks for reaching out! While currently this is not possible with our iFrame viewer, it would be possible to do using docviewer.js (https://crocodoc.com/docs/js-intro/), our fully customizable javascript-based viewing solution, if you have the engineering resources to create it yourself. Otherwise, this type of viewer will be much easier to make once our new version of Crocodoc is released in early fall, as you'll be able to download the raw HTML of the document at that point.

Thanks for reaching out! Here are some answers to your questions: 

1) You should only have one token for your application, rather than one per user of your application, so I don't think you should need to worry about login integration. 
2) Document assets are generally stored in our AWS bucket, but we do offer custom integrations with other AWS buckets, so if you'd prefer that we store document assets in your own AWS bucket, we can absolutely do that.
3) Currently, we charge a monthly fee for a minimum number of document uploads (plans start at $50 for a minimum of 500 document uploads in a month) with each document above the minimum being charged a minimal fee (typically $0.10/document.) At the volume you're discussing, which is an average of 300 document uploads, you'd likely want to start with our $50 starter plan. I've cc'ed my colleague Christian on this response, who can help you to determine what the best plan might be for you.

Generally, our policy has been to charge based on monthly uploads and in the case where a customer has started in the middle of the month, as you did, to prorate that amount based on the number of days they were active in the system. However, I took at look at your usage from the date of signup until the end of the month, and it looks like in this case all documents were uploaded prior to your upgrade. In this case, I can refund the charges for documents above the monthly minimum, and you will only be charged for 33% of the monthly minimum of $50/month ($16.50), as you were only active for 10 days and did not reach your minimum in that time.

As long as URLs you are sending to the Crocodoc API are publicly available, they should work. A good first test to see if this will be possible would be to try using one of your unique URLs in our test console to see if it would work: https://crocodoc.com/docs/api-console/. If you can successfully upload a document using a URL from your S3 bucket in the test console, then you should be able to do the same using our API. To get started with the API, check out our API documentation: https://crocodoc.com/docs/.

Let me know if you have any questions about the technical capabilities of Crocodoc! Otherwise, I'll let Christian take it from here.

You're right that Crocodoc only supports office documents and PDFs.

My apologies, I should have been clearer - this is an ongoing issue that we're working to resolve, and unfortunately, while I do have a bug report in, there has been no movement on it as of yet, as our engineering resources have been focused primarily on our paid API offering in the past few months. Unfortunately, this means it's difficult to offer an ETA on a resolution, though I'm continuing to follow up and escalate as best I can to get this resolved, as I know it's an extremely frustrating issue. As a workaround, have you tried highlighting in Chrome?

Just wanted to check in on this- could you provide me with some more information about the issue? Is happening with all documents that you attempt to upload? What error message are you seeing?

Thanks,

3299,"E245355016","Hi Robert,

Currently we're focusing on releasing the newest version of our document conversion service (more information at preview.crocodoc.com). While I can't say for sure whether or not we'll get to transition support within the next year, we know it's a feature many of our customers want, and we're absolutely exploring it for the future. I'll be sure to let the product team know that you find animation/transition support particularly valuable!

Thanks for the feedback, and all best,

This sounds like a browse support issue. Could you let me know which browser you're using to try to access Crocodoc, and whether you've enabled cookies?

3316,"E245363629","Hi JR,

You could use our annotation tools to blackout that information, but if a person knows how to look at the source code of the document or tries to copy the text, they'll be able to access it, so I'm not sure that's a great work around. My apologies for the inconvenience, and I'll let our product team know that a better solution would be helpful!

My apologies for the inconvenience you're experiencing! I'm glad you reached out so we can address the problem.

Any time you successfully upload a document to our servers, Crocodoc returns a UUID, regardless of whether we were able to convert that document. In order to diagnose the issue, could you send me the exact error code/message you received, as well as your username and a sample document that you were unable to convert?

Thanks very much!

3322,"E247131756","Hi Dustin, 

Would you mind sending me the code you were originally using for the HTTPS uploads? That shouldn't cause a problem, and in fact, as a general rule we require HTTPS for all API requests, so I'm surprised to hear that would be an issue!

Thanks,

My apologies for the delayed response. To my knowledge, Crocodoc is only used in the SpeedGrader tool presently, though I can reach out to Canvas to see if that has changed recently.

Just to clarify, are you hoping to embed Crocodoc personal documents in Desire2Learn? If so, it's not a direct process, but here's an article that helps to outline how you might use it with D2L: http://blogs.pstcc.edu/teachtech/2011/03/07/view-and-annotate-documents-with-crocodoc/

Thanks for reaching out! Have you checked out our new version, which we'll be releasing in early fall? It's significantly more mobile optimized- you can check it out at preview.crocodoc.com. If you'd like,  I'd be happy to schedule some time to chat about what you're hoping to build and how what we have in the pipeline might be able to help. Just let me know!

3347,"E247599948","Hi Robert,

Thanks for reaching out! Let me address your questions:

1) Yes, we will continue to support the current production version of Crocodoc after the release of the new version. If and when we decide to deprecate the current version (which won't be for months at earliest) we'll be sure to give users extensive notice and do all we can to make the transition as seamless as possible.
2) The new version of Crocodoc is a new API :) When we launch, we will recommend that users migrate based on their use case. In general, our goal is to make any migration as fast and easy as possible, so it shouldn't require too much effort to switch, should it make sense for you.

Thanks, and let me know if you have any other questions,

3351,"E248758885","Hi Chark, 

We can link your S3 bucket to your evaluation account. Please follow the instructions below for setting the permissions on your bucket and then send me your bucket name and the username of your evaluation account you want to have us link it to.

To set up S3, you'll need to create a bucket that will house all the assets Crocodoc creates. Ideally, this bucket should start out empty and not be used for anything besides Crocodoc. IMPORTANT: When creating the bucket, make sure it's name contains nothing but lower-case letters, numbers, and hyphens. 

Once this bucket is created, you'll need to grant our AWS account full permissions (List, Upload/Delete, View Permissions, Edit Permissions) on the bucket. Our AWS account is identified by admin@crocodoc.com; so that's what should go in the ""Grantee"" field if you're using the AWS web console to set this up.

Thanks, and let me know if you have any other questions I can help to resolve!

You'll need to get the link to the form you need from the program itself- it sounds like the program is using Crocodoc to host their file, but unfortunately, that means I can't tell you where exactly to find it!

Sorry I can't be more helpful, and let me know if you run into any trouble using Crocodoc!

My apologies for the inconvenience! As you suspected, the Personal version uses a different conversion engine, which is why it's able to work there and not in the API. Could you share the document in question with me so I can pass it along to our engineers so we can get it working in the API?

So sorry for the inconvenience! Your rate limit is set at 5 simultaneous conversions, so if you tried to send all 75 at once, you'd definitely run into rate limit issues. I've increased your rate limit to 10 to help address the issue while you run your batch conversion. Let me know if you continue to experience issues!
