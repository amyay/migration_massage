Also, what is the scope of ID?  We have multiple user bases and there is no way to uniquely distinguish one user from one base from another user in another base.  These users would not be annotating the same documents.  For example:

Site A has user A with ID 21.
Site B has user B with ID 21.
We have only one Crocodoc account.
Site A has document A where user A has made an annotation.
Site B has document B  where user B has made an annotation.

635,"Q99164702","Hi guys,

I love crocodoc, but I have some issue on IPAD when I try a horizontal scroll scroll, I doesn't trigger the scrolling, if I use embed mode preview , ex:

http://personal.crocodoc.com/{ID}?embedded=true.


But I found that using Session mode view 

https://crocodoc.com/docs/walkthrough/comments/    -- (second point, ""Embed the document"")


this Iframe woks fine on IPAD.

and My question is:

-Can I use this iframe but having an easy URL and not to create a session after to use API... ?

-If it is not possible, can I get the session from client site, because I have to make a POST top get the session, I guess using JS is not really going to because the cross domain restriction , or I can be wrok

- Or any another way to use the second type of view, which works fine on IPAD.


Thank you guys !!!!

635,"Q99223143","Hi Alex,

Unfortunately, at present this is no way to create a permanent session, so you'll always have to create a new session in order to view your documents using our API. We know this something that our community really wants, though, so it may be available in the future (we'll keep you posted!) 

As for generating the session, our API is designed to support only server-side session creation. You can read more about how to do so here: https://crocodoc.com/docs/api/#session-create

Thanks for reaching out, and let me know if you have any other questions or issues I can help you resolve!

655,"Q99800378","Hi All,

Please could you all post the quote you received from Crocodoc? I feel they are taking me for a ride. Back in 2011, I was quoted $50/month for up to 50 documents per month, which I thought was reasonable.

It's taken me sometime to develop the my code which plugs into the API. I'm about there with it and I've asked Crocodoc to requote me. 

Now they're saying the minimum plan they do is $250 per month for 2,500 documents uploaded. I find this overkill and overpriced.

How can it increase 5X in 8 months?

I'd like to know what you've all recently been quoted in the last few months.

655,"Q99956660","Hi Stephen,

I'm so sorry that you feel misled by our pricing-- that indicates a failure in communication, and for that, we apologize.  In the interest of being as transparent as possible, let me explain the thought behind the change. For our lowest volume customers, the price per document remains the same-- it was and remains $0.10/document. We did, however, increase the minimum document volume to better reflect the volumes that the majority of our customers use. In the interest of streamlining our offerings, when we made the change from API v1 to API v2, we adjusted our pricing plans to reflect those volumes. We've also made available a number of features in this minimum plan that were previously only available to much higher volume customers, including option to white label and Amazon S3 storage integration. We also made some substantial improvements to our offering, including: 

* Faster document conversion and rendering 

* Custom viewer skinning

* Support for iOS and Android devices 

* Support for Excel documents (currently in beta)

* Notification web hooks invoked whenever annotations are modified within a document

* Improved thumbnail generation and text extraction utilities 

That said, that doesn't excuse our failure to better explain the reasons for the change.  We know we have a responsibility to be open with our community, and we'll try to be more communicative going forward. 

We are considering reinstating a lower volume threshold plan, so we appreciate the feedback, and will be in touch to figure out a plan that better fits your needs.

Thank you for reaching out, and please don't hesitate to ask if you have any other questions or concerns!



All best,

655,"Q105508527","Ah, should have seen this before. 

For feedback sake - somehow we were under the impression that there is a 500 docs minimum plan (someone told us, our fault that we did not verify by asking) and went ahead and spent a few hours of development time integrating Crocodoc into our app. Wanted to go live and heard back from head of biz dev about the minimum of 2500 (he did offer to lower it to 1500). 

That is just too many documents for us and I would imagine, for most other rank new startup launches -- but I guess we are not your target customer segment. 

It would be massively helpful if you guys can mention the pricing on your site, so we can make more informed upfront decision about using Crocodoc. 

This a teeny bit frustrating, as it is an awesome product and we would have loved to let our usage grow organically. $150 to $250 p.m. to even see if the users use the feature, is just too much.

Here's generally how it works:

1) Make an API request to upload a document (either via URL or POST).  Store the returned uuid in your database.
2) Make an API request to generate a viewing session by passing in the document uuid and any other desired settings.  Use the returned session token to create the viewing URL.

Users do need to keep track of their document uuids on their own, since for security reasons we don't expose a way to fetch all document uuids for a given account.

If I have the extension bar of my browser disabled and still stumble though the website. I see the iFrame. With the bar it seems to just interact with the website and do  normal  direct links. Even with the iFrames I was still able to see the Google Analytics code within the frame, so even those should  count . I can't claim to understand how the numbers for a lot of us are going down, but at the moment this iFrame change does not seem to be it. What I have noticed is that once I got into a group of stumblers with people sending me stuff back and forth, I have not seen a SU  spike . So at least for me there is a corollary. Perhaps they are deweighting the share-wheels. In that they are trying to reduce the manipulation through the wheels. Ok, I understand this to an extent, but if there are very few stumblers from outside the wheel due to low ratings, then how are things then rated? I don't have many answers, just questions.

А просто дайте им попробовать поработать в ОС Линукс, установленной хотя бы на виртуальной машине. Дело ведь не только в  свободном ПО , а в его функциональности. У меня без проблем определил подключеный телефон и предложил настроить выход в Интернет, без проблем установил принтер и bluetooth-адаптер, при этом с подключенными устройствами можно было работать сразу же после подключения. Да, первое время будет сложно перестроиться на новую ОС, но пользователи в свое время приспосабливались же к WinNT-платформе, после Win9x. Я пересел на ОС Линукс за 2 дня, при этом не имея представления о ее работе, о скриптах и работе в терминале. У меня тоже были проблемы с установкой и настройкой, приходилось несколько раз переустанавливать ОС, пока не разобрался. Признаюсь, что перед этим экспериментировал с данной ОС на виртуальной машине.  Ну фар и биос веселые ребята. Однако кривой установки мне хватило надолго.

The download with this api requires our token (instead of a session key like doc viewing, even if we authorized document download when we gave the client the session key), so we have to proxy this through us, which complexify the code and uses bandwith for no reason. The point of having the downloadable option when creating the session key is so that the client can download the document directly!

I just started the integration with Crocodocs and node.js. For the upload functionality seems like Crocodocs server requires the filename to have the correct extension, it seems to be ignore the content-type header which has the correct content type.

I ran a few experiments that prove my hypothesis but would like Crocodocs to verify it. And even better, will prefer that the server not have the restriction rather use the content type, which is a better/much reliable solution, as I thought content sniffing based on extension is frowned upon.

It seems that people are just replying with a non-commital  +1  or  Like it .This is very poor feed back. Many of the voters are upvoting designs that are sensationalist and flashy, but actually provide little aesthetic or poor architecture and may ultimately not be the right solution for the data that exists. I would urge you when voting for entries to answer a few questions about the design:What scenarios is the site designed for?Is the intended design appropriate for the target audience?Does the style achieve the desired effect?What are the pros and cons of each design?Does the design use extraneous amounts of data in one place (ie, information overload)?Is it easy to scan?Is the typography clear?Can you find a takano's github in under 4 seconds?Remember, there is more to design than just fancy graphics. Don't forget architecture, speed, usability, maintainability, and others.It's important that you be respectful in your critique. In any well-done critique, we see two themes that run concurrently: the positive impressions the design leaves on the critic and the concerns the critic has about the design's direction. This balances hard-to-hear criticism with the good things the design owner did.

1534,"Q160996660","OMG .You would not believe this. This is too frakey!You know how this blog is a synchronicity with mine. That is the first weird thing.  Similar topic, same photo!The second synchronicity .I pulled 3 cards on this spread this afternoon. I got 3 cards, and found them interesting, but did not fully understand them. I used the Silver Era Tarot as part of preparing and practicing with it before a video review on that deck.Tonight, you suggested I post the cards I got. And dayum I could not for the life of me remember what I got. So I decided to draw new ones from the  same deck. Guess what. Same cards, same order, but this time I realized that the first time they came out all reversed and now they came out all upright. I remembered that they were all court cards, all reversed the first time around (now upright) and seeing them again instantly triggered my memory.What not to do: Knight of WandsWhat to do: King of WandsChange this: King of SwordsAs you may know,, 10 years ago was during that process when I entered my great spiritual shift away from Catholicism. That the cards arrived reversed the first time (same order, and yes, I shuffled) and now upright could mean several things:- taking note of the internal shift manifesting gradually to my external physical world, but not there yet- I was just starting out with tarot, only a couple of years, and hadn't fully broken away from the church and the reversals could indicate some residual pessimism I had regarding my concerns with tarot as seen through the eyes of the church as well as being criticized by my family.- I was getting mixed messages from the church and family, and was mixed up myself-feeling pessimism or doubt about something (was it the Catholicism or the tarot or the struggle between the two at the time?)This shift from reversal to upright shows a  huge shift in me from then to now, suggesting that what I thought then did go through a huge paradigm shift. I am in such a different place now than I was 10 years ago. And as you know, very positive about tarot and self-expression now.10 years ago:What not to do: Knight of Wands   don't express your true self, stay within the lines. Don't tell people, don't get out there, don't share messages about what you do. Keep the fire contained. Step back from conflict (this card looks to me like the horse is walking backwards).Do this: King of Wands: Show mature creativity I knew I needed to expand my sense of expression, and wanted to do it in a way that reflected my Saturn-return, a term I didn't even know at the time. This King card trumps the  don't do  of the Knight of Wands and the King did take over. I chose the bigger energy, started to express myself, manage my own life, harness my own fire by creating my own kingdom rather than following in the path of what I was expected to do. My inner Aries (with the Leo rising) lit on fire and I was suddenly at the reins, just now giving myself permission to go on a ride of personal expression to the fullest. The King trumped the Knight.Change this: King of Swords. I let go of letting people tell me what do do, what not to do, what to think. I changed how I managed my own thoughts and our thoughts do create our reality. I stopped being so doggone analytical and let my intuitive side start to flow through instead.  I changed keeping everything under complete control as was expected by society, and let my spirit flow more freely. I let go of priestly devotion and hiding behind others' thoughts and criticisms. I took charge and created my own life laws and let go of people judging me, criticizing me, and dictating to me what is supposed to be. I did change the intellectual base to allow the intuitive side to flow freely, so I listened to the call to change this King of Swords.I'm flabbergasted that the same cards came up twice in the same order.Great spread idea, Angelo!

1642,"Q153519584","I would like to strongly recommend Crocodoc enabling LaText to HTML conversion. 

This would be huge for many sectors of academia as well as math an engineering-oriented industries.

Is there a timeline to enable this conversion. There are existing tools for people to do this on their own but if was just as simple as Crocodoc makes PDF/DOC to HTML conversion then I think this would really improve the reach of Crocodoc's business.

1878,"Q164714791","Hi, 

Are there any plans to enable DOM manipulation or CSS modification of the DOC via the API or other?  One of the benefits of converting to HTML5 from PDF would be the ability for the content distributor to take advantage of responsive/fluid rendering. 

A use-case: Content consumer who wishes to view the document from the content distributor web App on a mobile device without the annoyance of having deal with the same constraints of PDF on mobile (i.e. non-fluid paragraphs requiring lots of scrolling/panning to see content).  

This type of control over how the DOC renders would make Crocodoc a clear winner in my mind and I'd be very interested to know whether it's currently in development or if there's a way to tap into this level of control already.

2102,"Q176432982","Could we get Amazon SNS/SQS support for the webhooks?

It would be ideal if you could setup webhooks so that they post to a specified SNS Topic or publish to a specific SQS Topic using a specific amazon IAM user. This would make developing a fully automated system really easy and allow distribution of servers in a much cleaner manner, eliminating the single point of failure that the current webhook implementation creates. Either or both implementations should be fairly easy as they're just simple HTTP requests.

2215,"Q187851995","Rival legal teams, well-financed and highly motivated, are girding for court battles over the coming months on laws enacted in Arkansas and North Dakota that would impose the nation's toughest bans on abortion. 
For all their differences, attorneys for the two states and the abortion-rights supporters opposing them agree on this: The laws represent an unprecedented frontal assault on the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that established a nationwide right to abortion. 
The Arkansas law, approved March 6 when legislators overrode a veto by Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe, would ban most abortions from the 12th week of pregnancy onward. On March 26, North Dakota went further, with Republican Gov. Jack Dalrymple signing a measure that would ban abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, when a fetal heartbeat can first be detected and before some women even know they're pregnant. 
Abortion-rights advocates plan to challenge both measures, contending they are unconstitutional violations of the Roe ruling that legalized abortion until a fetus could viably survive outside the womb. A fetus is generally considered viable at 22 to 24 weeks.

On-Page SEO means more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you?

2447,"Q239641185","There is no denying that Eritrea, like all coiurtnes in Africa and other parts of the world, will need to work on its human rights record.  However, given the highly negative role that the British gov. has been playing in the Horn of Africa, I read this report with a large pinch of salt.I find the report to be self-serving, selective and highly political.  The report stays mum on massive Human Rights abuses in a number of ‘friendly’ coiurtnes.For example, the atrocities that have been committed in Ethiopia are completely ignored.The collective rights of the entire population of Eritrea have been abused historically by the international community in general and the British gov. in particular in denying Eritreans their independence and providing unconditional support to successive Ethiopian governments to commit unimaginable atrocities in Eritrea. The British gov. today not only turns a blind eye when the rights of Eritreans to live in peace is being violated and their land occupied in violation of international law, but is at the forefront of coiurtnes that pushed for unjust and unfair sanctions against the people of Eritrea without presenting a shred of evidence to support it.  An arms embargo is placed on Eritrea while Ethiopia is left scot free to wage unprovoked attack against it.  Eritreans are denied their basic rights to self defence, which is enshrined in the UN Charter. The British gov has been providing Ethiopia a diplomatic, political and financial support to enable it avoid punishment for violating the final and binding rulings of the Boundary Commission and continue with its occupation of Eritrean sovereign land.Many Eritreans are still unable to return back to their ancestral land that has been occupied by force for over ten years.   Isn’t this a violation of human rights? Am I now expected to believe that the British gov. sincerely care for the Human Rights of the people of Eritrea?

2762,"Q206134963","Hi Sebastian,

The example code you see in our documentation is just curl, but probably the easiest place for you to start would actually be with our API Libraries (http://crocodoc.com/docs/libraries). We have libraries for PHP, Java, Python and Ruby (as well as a few additional third-party libraries.) These will help make it really easy to use our API, as they have full examples for all the major operations you might need. Please let me know if you run into any trouble using them (you can email support@crocodoc.com), and I'd be happy to help you out!

How did you upload your files? Were you using one of our free developer accounts, or did you use one of our test consoles? In order to download a document that you've uploaded, you'll need the API token that was used to upload the document, as well as the UUID of the document.

2781,"Q206625181","Hi Hitesh,

I'm glad to see you've found our API Libraries! It sounds like you're experiencing errors when trying to run examples.php because of an SSL certificate issue - keep in mind that all API requests require HTTPS. As for your more general questions,  right now it's required that you upload your documents to us so that we can convert them to HTML. 

Basically, here's how the flow works: when you successfully upload a document, you'll receive a unique identifier (a UUID) for that document which you can use to generate a session any time a user wants to see the document. You can use that session as the URL in an iFrame to display the document in your app. 

It sounds like maybe a good place for you to start would be with one of our walkthroughs, which will help you to create your first session: https://crocodoc.com/docs/walkthrough/embed/.

Let me know if you have any other questions via support@crocodoc.com, and I'll do all I can to get you up and running as soon as possible!

So I thought to be smart and generate a shared folder where everyone can upload his docs. Alas, it appears that by uploading to a shared folder, the uploader will not receive any notifications when his doc has been edited/annotated. That kind of defies the purpose of what I try to to do.

Crocodoc currently supports point comment annotation on iPads, but LMSes choose independently whether to enable that functionality or not for their mobile applications, so you'll need to check with each provider to see if they've chosen to provide that functionality. Other annotation tools like drawing are on our roadmap, though I can't offer you a release date or an ETA at this time.

Some important aspects you should know before you play Bingo Online

When you're searching the Internet and find a new online bingo site you've never seen before, you should consider the following things before opening an account in online bingo sites:

 First, you must read all the information or print that you find on the new site where you want to play before you start betting. We can assure you that there are many online bingo sites listed or announced that have passed certain quality control tests with no problems. In fact, most are reviewed and lose their gaming license if not follow the correct guidelines or policies of the game. The program also must have a certain criteria and standards, and the games will use a standard number generator (RNG), a payout percentage, which means that the outcome of each game is not predictable, as in the real bingo. You can usually find the name of the program provider in the homepage of the game. Worth reading about the company's program to see how long they run and how healthy and safe is your program. Also find out how long it has been running the bingo site. If you have just been released, there <a href=""http://onlineroulettecasinono1.weebly.com"">online roulette</a> may be some initial problems and issues that need to be corrected. It may be better to wait to see how honest and becomes popular page.

You should see live information such as date and time in the game window when you're playing. This indicates that the site is real time.

 Second, you must find out everything you can about the customer service that is offered! There could be a phone number you can call and may also offer a real-time chat. Sites like jeuxbingoligne.com offer a telephone service 24 hours. Others only have this email, which takes longer for a response. Prefer to play bingo sites that offer several appropriate ways to contact them. Call the customer service line if you want, just to see if it works and can be useful as the customer service staff.Third, try to play on a site with a brand that is honest or a part of a chain of bingo sites, and one that other players have a good opinion. There are many forums and portals available to read reviews and news about home site. Keep up to date and well informed, as it is the first step to win and even get free bonus money! There are some sites whose job is to help online bingo find the most professional, safe and fun there.

Another important aspect to be aware of the conspiracy. This occurs when a number of people come into contact to help them win another. Most sites have a fraud department watching the games looking for conspiracies. In fact, check the terms and conditions of the site and you can read about the politics of fraud there. Most games are multi-player games. While playing with other players to chat and communicate with them. In fact, it would be a good idea to enter the chat room and see how many people are playing and if it's a good idea to join. With many people in the chat room you can consider that the game is very good and popular, but the lower the chance to win bingo bonus.

If you're playing roulette and you are disconnected after making your bet, and before pressing the Spin button, your bet is returned to your balance. If it happens after you place your bets and Spin has been pressed, but before the ball stops in a number, the round will continue. If, as you play Video Bingo disconnection occurs after you put your bet on the text box and call credits or Bet you did not press the Deal button, or even steal, then the credits will be returned to your balance. If it happens after you press the Deal button, or steal, but before you have the opportunity to select the cards that would release, the round is considered as if you selected and drop all your cards. If your hand becomes the winner, your balance is credited accordingly.

Any news related to the game is updated weekly, giving you all the latest information of bingo you need, to have the best chance of winning. Some sites offer live data sources and provide an alarm program to find out about the latest bonuses and promotions offered.

These are the most important things you need to know to have fun and be lucky. So pay attention to all of them, for your safety and security is most important to you.

2944,"Q239158855","Hi Christopher thank you so much for answering my qusiteon.  I was wondering if you might be able/willing to give me further clarification.  The page URLs on tharpa.com are all like this:    tharpa.com/country/bookWhich means that right now Tharpas UK & US need unique URLs to promote common book content.However, we'd like one common URL for publicity and promotion purposes that would lead people to their respective country (i.e. UK or US). For example, we could have a URL such as tharpa.com/esh (for Eight Steps to Happiness) and then when people typed this in they would automatically be redirected to tharpa.com/uk/esh or tharpa.com/us/esh. Therefore, tharpa.com/esh would have lots of content (videos, etc) and we would widely promote that URL in social media,  press releases, Adwords, etc, but that page would be a redirect only. The reason for it being a redirect and not a static page where people then add to cart based on the country is because we don't want to send people to a static stand-alone page, we want to send them to a fully functioning website. And the website only really functions if people see prices in their currency, etc. If they have to choose their country, it's not seemless or ideal.Would this markup still work in this way?  If not, what would be a viable solution for us?  We really appreciate your help/guidance, thank you!","2013-07-31 08:41:51","customer","n"

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6266 specifies that the Content-Disposition header/filename can contain non ascii characters when using the filename* key. a 500 seems a bit rough ;)

so just out of curiosity i tried this:

[...]

so if i use the non documented parameter filename* instead i will not get an error but the file - but it will ignore my submitted filename.

that seems a bit odd to me.

could you please clarify:
- does crocodoc support non ascii filenames on the download function? currently/in the future?
- is that filename* parameter official or a bug/feature? will it stay or go away?

We hope the Azzurri go on to achieve great things in it in Poland and Ukraine next year.ï¿½ï¿½
The Italy Puma World Cup 2010 home and away kits were officially launched last week. Included as part of the kit launch was the Italy Puma World Cup 2010 Goalkeeper kit. However, at the time detailed images of Gianluigi Buffon's new strip were not readily available. Now they are. Here's a detailed look at the first choice Puma jersey, shorts and socks of Italy's goalkeepers for FIFA World Cup 2010 and the 2010/12 period.
Known to USA soccer fans as the current club of American midfielder Benny Feilhaber, AGF Aarhus is one of the most successful football teams in Denmark. AGF holds record for the longest consecutive period in the Danish top division and also holds the record for most number of cup wins. However, the club has struggled with poor results since its Danish Cup winning 1995/96 season and currently plays in the second-best tier of the league system, the Danish First Division, following its relegation from the Danish Superliga at the end of last season.

3067,"Q239436356","We needed some kind of steuricy system installed as we have some problem neighbors doing juvenile stuff on our property. So far, so good on this unit. We bought it from a  big box store  so we'd be able to return it easily if it wasn't quite what we wanted.  This week, we set up all four cameras at the front of our house. I had no problems getting everything to work straight out of the box. I like the long cables but I think I'd like to see higher quality cameras provided. They're fine and they're in focus and everything is recognizable, but I doubt I'd be able to do any facial recognition from across the street. The  quick guide  wasn't really much help in trying to find the main administrator menu on the machine.  Virtual keyboard ?? Found it by accident by madly clicking on the screen. Once I got into the system, it became easier of course and I already feel safer just knowing that my property is being  watched . I'll write an update on how the system is working after I've had it up and running for a couple of weeks. Update April 2010: I've now had this unit for about 5 months and it still does exactly what I wanted. It sits there quietly doing its thing; it's nice being able to review the recordings and discover which of our neighbors left the HUGE tire marks on the driveway or which local drunk peeled off at 100mph on Friday night at 2am.  Nice to have the proof especially when they vehemently deny it!  We've also been asked by our HOA to provide evidence of underage driving on our streets. Their Momma denied it (no not our little angels!) I provided the video evidence to the HOA. No more problems since then. Glad to help! Archiving scenes is pretty easy once you've done it a couple of times. I use a generic USB drive. No problems. Any criticisms? Yes, but minor ones really. I don't like the  FF  or  REW  features. You'll be revewing footage at, say, 5x speed, see the scene you want to review and it flies by while you're trying to press the  1x button or PAUSE or REVERSE button on screen. Very confusing. I'd also still prefer to have higher definition cameras, so I could make out licence plates/faces but even so, just having the cameras there acts as a great deterrent. Don't get me wrong, I don't sit there scrutinizing every second of footage. Most weeks I never even go near it. But it sure makes me feel safer and a little bit more informed about the goings on our crazy street. ","2013-07-31 18:47:55","customer","n"

We have an undocumented method for setting custom session length which I’m able to share:

When making an API call to create a session, users can now add a “duration” parameter to specify the number of seconds the session should be valid. This can range from 0 seconds (meaning the sessionwould expire immediately… not very useful) to ~50 years (1576800000 seconds).

Here’s a simple example request to make a session that would last 24 hours (86400 seconds):

3314,"Q244960137","I am building a academic paper sharing website. After I learn about Crocodoc's greate annotation feature, I decided to give up my original system and use Crocodoc instead. However, we start to get very slow connection and frequent break down (show an server internal error) while viewing documents. My developer think it is a conflict between the server and crodoc script, the hosting company think it is crocodoc's script problem, and when I ask crocodoc technician, I can't get a proper answer. So I am stuck, with the old system removed and new crocodoc now working stably, I don't know what to do. My developer is asking me to replace the crocodoc system. I think I might just ask you guys one more time before I give up. By the way, I log 15 errors last months for this problem. 

Here is the error I got all the time: 

Internal Server Error
The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.

Please contact the server administrator, webmaster@wikiademic.com and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may have caused the error.

More information about this error may be available in the server error log.

Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.

Currently, we do not offer download of the rendered HTML, only the original document or the annotated PDF if you choose to use our annotations. If you send us the UUID of the document that you were unable to download, I can take a look and see if I can identify what's going on. Sorry for the inconvenience!

3341,"Q246495875","I need to know if anyone has seen font changes within a submitted document through Blackboard.  The Crocodoc view shows a different font throughout the document.  The downloaded document is fine - not weird fonts.  

I noted this seems to happen if there is an apostrophe or quote marks within the text line.  There may be other special characters causing this, I haven't found them yet.

3341,"Q247134043","Hi Cynthia,

Occasionally our conversion engine substitutes fonts that are not embedded or not available in the document when converting them to HTML to display online. If you send us the documents in question, we can use them to improve our engine going forward so that fewer of these occasional substitutions occur going forward.

Thanks for your help!

3344,"Q247227132","We're new to this integration and notice while grading our assignments using Crocodoc, some of our changes aren't saved even though we've clicked on Bb's ""Save as Draft"" button. Is there a separate save button for the inline commenting/grading we do through Crocodoc or does Crocodoc auto save periodically? We're using 9.1 SP10.

Thanks,
Elaine","2013-08-15 23:09:31","customer","y"
3344,"Q248794630","Hi Elaine,

Crocodoc does autosave, though if you make a comment or other annotation and then very quickly navigate away from the page before it has a chance to autosave, you might lose the comment. I'm so sorry for the inconvenience! One way to help address this issue is to make sure to click outside the annotation after making it- essentially, changing the focus from the annotation back to the document itself- this helps to expedite the saving process. I know this is frustrating, and we're exploring ways to address the problem going forward.

Let me know at support@crocodoc.com if you continue to run into problems!

Best,
